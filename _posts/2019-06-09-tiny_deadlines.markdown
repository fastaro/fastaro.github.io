This project was what I like to call sneaky hard.  On the surface it looked pretty simple- analyze the dataset and come up with some questions and answer them.  But coming up with good questions was more difficult than answering them.  

It’s funny we had to do a thank you section.. and I forgot to put the person I want to thank the most - Marcus Aurelius.  After I watched  a video on his tips for self discipline.  Everything all of a sudden clicked in my brain.  Set tiny deadlines that lead you to your main goal. Be honest with yourself while simultaneously being compassionate with yourself.  You’re ineffective when beating yourself up.  Don’t let bad days immobilize you, roll with the punches and get the job done.

Stoicism gave me the keys to channel my cynicism into productivity.

It was sneaky hard because I had to really wonder what I would want to know if I ran the business.. and then think of the correct way to test those ideas.  

The database also had some weird issues that were kinda unrealistic.  But if you think about it - getting actual customer information would be a little unethical.  

Still, it reminded me how important it is to make sure you’re getting good data.  Bad data increases the likelihood of type 1 and type 2 errors.  

So overall I’m proud of myself for getting it done.  But there’s always room for improvement and there’s still a lot more Flatiron to go!
